                                2023 to August 2023. During this internship, I gained significant skills in Python
                                programming, Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Linux, and Database Management
                                Systems
                                (DBMS).</p>

                            <p> I worked on practical coding exercises and projects, which allowed me to apply the
                                theoretical knowledge I gained and develop hands-on experience in real-world scenarios.
